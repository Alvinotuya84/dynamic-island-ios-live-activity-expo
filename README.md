# transit-pulse-tracker

A sample implementation built with Expo GL and iOS Live Activities.

## Overview

Transit Pulse Tracker is a sample implementation of an iOS application that combines 3D visualization powered by Expo GL with iOS Live Activities for real-time transit updates. The app provides a seamless experience for tracking public transportation routes, showing real-time updates on the lock screen and in the Dynamic Island.

## Features

- **3D Visualization**: Interactive 3D map of transit routes using Expo GL
- **Live Activities**: Real-time transit updates on the iOS lock screen

- React Native with Expo
- Expo GL for 3D visualization
- THREE.js for 3D rendering
- Expo Router for navigation
- Custom Expo Module API for native integration
- ActivityKit for iOS Live Activities
- Swift and SwiftUI for native components
